# 🔒 Security Guidelines

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: API Key Security

### ✅ What We've Done
- ✅ Removed `config.ini` with exposed API keys
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future API key exposure
- ✅ Cleaned up all sensitive files and data
- ✅ Added comprehensive security patterns to `.gitignore`

### 🚨 IMPORTANT: Your API Keys Were Exposed
Your `config.ini` file contained real API keys that were visible. I've removed this file, but you should:

1. **Immediately rotate/regenerate ALL API keys:**
   - Gemini API keys: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) → Create new keys
   - Twitter API keys: Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) → Regenerate keys
   - TwitterAPI.io key: Go to [TwitterAPI.io](https://twitterapi.io/) → Generate new key

2. **Never commit API keys again:**
   - Always use `config.ini.example` as template
   - Keep your real `config.ini` local only
   - The `.gitignore` now prevents this

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

#### For API Keys:
- ✅ Use environment variables when possible
- ✅ Keep `config.ini` in `.gitignore` (already done)
- ✅ Use different keys for development/production
- ✅ Regularly rotate API keys
- ❌ Never hardcode keys in source code
- ❌ Never commit config files with real keys

#### For Repository:
- ✅ Review files before committing
- ✅ Use `git status` to check what's being committed
- ✅ Keep sensitive data in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use example/template files for configuration

### 🔍 Files That Should NEVER Be Committed:
```
config.ini          # Contains real API keys
*.db               # Database files with user data
*.log              # Log files may contain sensitive info
*_cache.json       # Cache files with API responses
replied_ids_cache.json  # Contains tweet IDs you've interacted with
```

### ✅ Safe Files to Commit:
```
config.ini.example      # Template without real keys
*.py                   # Source code (without hardcoded keys)
README.md             # Documentation
requirements.txt      # Dependencies
.gitignore           # Security protection
```

### 🚀 Before Pushing to GitHub:
1. Run: `git status` - Check what files are being committed
2. Run: `grep -r "AIza\|sk-\|AAAA" .` - Search for potential API keys
3. Verify no sensitive data in files being committed
4. Push only after confirming safety

### 🆘 If You Accidentally Commit API Keys:
1. **Immediately** rotate/regenerate all exposed keys
2. Remove the commit from history: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
3. Force push: `git push --force-with-lease`
4. Or contact GitHub support to purge the commit

**Remember: Security is not optional. Always double-check before committing!**
